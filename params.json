{"name":"Fireblog","tagline":"A basic blog (in Python)","body":"# Fireblog\r\nA simple blog, written in Python, using the\r\n[Pyramid web framework](https://www.github.com/pylons/pyramid). For a live\r\nversion, see [my blog](https://blog.ismail-s.com).\r\n\r\nNote that this project, whilst being used for my website hasn't been made fully ready to be used on any website. In other words, I hope to make it easier and quicker to setup and manage the website, as well as upgrade it. Hopefully soon.\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\nFirst make sure there is a running local instance of [redis](http://redis.io>).\r\nThen run the following commands:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n  git clone https://github.com/ismail-s/fireblog.git\r\n  cd fireblog\r\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n  python setup.py develop\r\n  initialize_fireblog_db development.ini\r\n  mkdir reload-spooler\r\n  uwsgi --ini-paste-logged development.ini\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo note when running those commands that:\r\n\r\n- you use a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)\r\n- You don't use development.ini when running in production.\r\n  This is because development.ini enables the debug toolbar, which allows\r\n  arbitrary code execution. For a warning of what this could result in, see\r\n  [this article](http://arstechnica.co.uk/security/2015/10/patreon-was-warned-of-serious-website-flaw-5-days-before-it-was-hacked/).\r\n\r\n- If you want to run the server in production mode as a daemon, then run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n  uwsgi --ini-paste-logged production.ini\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you wish to customise stuff, eg use a database like postgres instead of\r\nsqlite (the default), then change the .ini file you pass to these commands.\r\n\r\n# Managing the database\r\nThe `initialize_fireblog_db` script does 4 things when run:\r\n\r\n1. Creates the db with the required tables if they don't exist already\r\n1. Updates the db to the latest version if necessary\r\n1. Creates a first post if no posts exist already\r\n1. Makes sure all required settings are in the settings table, prompting the\r\n   user of the script to input values if a value doesn't exist or is invalid.\r\n\r\nThis means that this script doesn't accept any parameters besides the ini\r\nfile which says where the db is. The script is also safe to run at any\r\npoint, to either create, update or check the db. So, at the moment, the way\r\nthe website can be updated is by doing a `git pull` to get the latest code,\r\ntaking down the webiste, running the `initialize_fireblog_db` script and\r\nthen starting the website again.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
